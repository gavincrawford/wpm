# WPM

## Overview

## Profiles

Data can be stored in profiles to track your progress. The default profile file will be created at the same directory of the binary itself when executed for the first time, making it easy to find, and clean, as no other files are created/edited anywhere else in your file system. Data is stored in the CBOR format.
