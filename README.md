# WPM

## Overview

`wpm` is a modern, sleek, and portable typing trainer/tester. It is intended to be compact, and fit for developers who like to keep their environments simple and concise. `wpm` also tracks history, improvement over time, and helps you analyze your growth as you train.

## Profiles

Data can be stored in profiles to track your progress. The default profile file will be created at the same directory of the binary itself when executed for the first time, making it easy to find, and clean, as no other files are created/edited anywhere else in your file system. Data is stored in the CBOR format.

## System Requirements

The only system requirement is any [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), which allows more complex icons to be drawn, which improve the user experience.
